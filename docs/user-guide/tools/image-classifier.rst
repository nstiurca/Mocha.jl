Image Classifier
================

A simple image classifier interface is provided in
``tools/image-classifier.jl``. It wraps a network and provides an easy-to-use
interface that takes an arbitrary number of images and returns the classification
results as both class probabilities and symbolic class names. Please see
:doc:`/tutorial/ijulia-imagenet` for an example on how to use this interface.
